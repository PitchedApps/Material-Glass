    <string-array name="answers">
        <item>Firstly, please make sure you\'ve rebooted your phone.
            If the issue is in some part that is essential, such as the notification drawer, it is likely not an issue on my side.
            If there truly is an issue however, feel free to post a bug report in my g+ community or send me an email.
            Please note that low ratings do not help solve the problems.
        </item>
        <item>Those two apps have restrictions that prevents it from being transparent, which is why I have themed them in black for now.
            In the event that this is fixed, I will definitely make it transparent.
        </item>
        <item>Please note that this is primarily a theme and not an icon pack.
            Though I will add some essential icons from time to time, I try to keep the icons limited to reduce the size of this app.
            If you want more icons, feel free to check some of my other icon packs.
        </item>
        <item>I am one user, with one phone. By simply using my theme and reporting any errors, you are helping me keep track of everything, as not all the themed apps are apps that I use.
            Feel free to also join the beta community for more updates, and to help me fix issues before it\'s released for everyone.
            Donations also help a lot as well!
        </item>
        <item>Though I don\'t exactly take in requests, especially for big apps since they take a long time (again, I am only one person), you may feel free to send them.
            Keep in mind that I am more likely to fulfill the request if it\'s a small app.
        </item>
        <item>It\'s needed to be able write icon requests data and files, as well as saving wallpapers, and being able to change Wallpapers\' download location.</item>
